# Cheat Sheets for R, Python, Git, Emacs, Vim, and many other System Administration tools for the Linux Command Line
The cheat sheets use the creative commons copyright. Please see the LICENSE document for more details.

## RStudio Cheatsheets
Mostly R data analysis package resources and useful cheatsheets I have picked up along the way.
The cheat sheets make it easy to learn about and use some of our favorite packages. They are published in their respective PDF versions here: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/, some are also available in the RStudio-IDE directory in the Help-Cheatsheets sub-directory.

## Tips for making a new cheat sheet
Keep these tips in mind when creating a new cheat sheet:

1. RStudio cheat sheets are hosted at https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets. You can submit new cheat sheets to the repository with a pull request.

2. The cheat sheets are not meant to be text documents. Ideally, they are scannable visual aids that use layout and visual mnemonics to help people zoom into the functions they need. As an analogy, think of a cheat sheet as more like a well organized computer menu bar that leads you to a command than a manual that documents each command.

3. The cheat sheets use a cohesive, black and white printer friendly theme (which is what you see in the sheets), so please stay close to the appearance of the existing sheets.

4. It's already baked into every cheat sheet and the template, but you should include a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) Copyright on each side of the sheet to make them easy to repurpose.
